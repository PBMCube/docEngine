DocEngine
=========

DocEngine is PHP project that parses markdown pages to generate sophisticated documentation sites.

DocEngine documentations can contain multiple languages and dynamic, editable inline examples.

For a (work in progress) documentation and demo, navigate to [http://wearekiss.com/docEngine](http://wearekiss.com/docEngine).
DocEngine is hosted there, documenting itself ;)
